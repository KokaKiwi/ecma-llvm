A small pseudo-ECMAScript (more Javascript) compiler.

It's not targeted to be a fully-featured JS compiler, it's more a test of the LLVM library.

Requirements:
- CMake (Building tools): http://www.cmake.org/
- LLVM libraries (LLVM IR code generation): http://llvm.org/
- Ragel (Lexer generating): http://www.complang.org/ragel/
- Lemon (Parsing generating): http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/

- ECMAScript 262 grammar file (from Aptana Studio 2): https://github.com/aptana/studio2/blob/master/tools/com.aptana.ide.parsing.tools/Parser%20Files/ECMAScript-262.bnf
